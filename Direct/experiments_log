- model only with cnns:
    -out loss was always two small (1e-6 vs 0.12) with cifar10 after 10 epochs, 1000 samples, batchSize 100
        learning rate = 0.00001 (maybe too small)
- model with linear part, like alexnet but with fewer channels (cifar10 image size is 32x32)
    -out loss reduced to 0.027 but stayed there for ever. 5 epochs, 1000 samples, batchSize 100,
        learning rate 0.001 and then 0.0001 with weight decay did not change anything
- pretrained model (alexnet) for features (cifar10). Loss around 0.6
